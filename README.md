# Website Performance Analysis using Python

## Project Overview
This project analyzes website performance data to understand user behavior,
traffic sources, and engagement patterns across different time periods and channels.

The goal is to identify high-performing channels and peak engagement hours
to support data-driven business and marketing decisions.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset contains website traffic data including:
- Channel Group (traffic source)
- Date & Hour
- Users
- Sessions
- Engaged Sessions
- Average Engagement Time

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Fixed structural issues by converting the first row into column headers
- Removed invalid rows and reset index
- Converted date-hour column into proper datetime format
- Converted all performance metrics into numeric data types
- Handled missing and invalid values
- Created new features such as hourly traffic for time-based analysis

## Analysis Performed
- Channel-wise user and session analysis
- Hour-wise traffic and engagement trends
- Comparative performance of different traffic sources
- User engagement behavior across time

## Key Insights
- Identified top-performing traffic channels
- Discovered peak hours with highest user activity
- Highlighted engagement patterns useful for marketing optimization

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics workflow:
from raw data cleaning to feature engineering and insight generation.
It reflects real-world website performance analysis used in digital marketing
and business intelligence.

## Note
This project was built by following a tutorial and independently understanding,
modifying, and analyzing each step to strengthen practical data analytics skills.
